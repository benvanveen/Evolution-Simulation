# Evolution Simulation Within Netlogo

## Introduction:
This project produces a simulation within netlogo that provides an example for emerging behaviours within environments, in this example, the evolution of wolves and sheep can be observed to analyse their ability to adapt to their specific environment.

## Getting Started:
- Netlogo is required to run the project.
- Download the code and open it within netlogo

## using the dashboard: 
- Many sliders can be manipulated to change the environment.
- Graphs can be used to observe changes in the environment more mathematically
